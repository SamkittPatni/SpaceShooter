# SpaceShooter
This is a remake of the retro game Space Shooter. The game has a main menu screen where the player can choose between a single player or multiplayer game, options, or exiting the game. The controls for the game can be found in the options menu. In the single player version, enemies come down from the top of the screen. Player gains points by shooting the enemy ships and loses lives when the enemy ship hits the player or goes below the screen. The player has 3 lives and the game ends when all these lives are exhausted. Powerups occasionally fall which gives the player perks. The game can be paused by pressing the escape key.

# Running the Game
The game can be run by going into the "Windows Playable Build" directory and running the executable file there. This build is only for a device run using the Windows operating system.
